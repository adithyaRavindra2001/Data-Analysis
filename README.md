# DataAnalysis
This repo contains code for fundamentals of Data Analysis 
I have followed the book Python For Data Analysis by Wes Mckinney and i recommend this book to anyone who is a beginner. You will require prior knowledge of python before
you start.
I hope you learnt something new today.
Cheers!
